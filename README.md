# Magic Fingers App (iOS 6.1, Xcode 4.6)
## Created by Brian Coyner

## App Details

The app tracks multiple touches. A `CAReplicatorLayer` spins a star image around each touch. 
The "options" popover allows the user to manipulate the `CAReplicatorLayer` while your 
fingers are down. 

## Highlights
- Multi-touch tracking
- Core Animation (`CAReplicatorLayer` and `CABasicAnimation`) to spin a star image around each touch
- Key Value Coding (KVC) and Key Value Observing (KVO)
- `UITableViewController` with custom cells that control the `BTSMagicOptions` object.
